        Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project 
        for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated
        at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion).
        The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect
        to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.

        The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim art in India
        and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best
        example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6 million
        visitors a year[3] and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000 to 2007) initiative.
