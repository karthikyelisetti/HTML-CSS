            <p>In January 1994, Yang and Filo were electrical engineering graduate students at Stanford University,
                when they created a website named "Jerry and David's guide to the World Wide Web". The site was a 
                human-edited web directory, organized in a hierarchy, as opposed to a searchable index of pages.
                In March 1994, "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" was renamed "Yahoo!" and became known
                as the Yahoo Directory. The "yahoo.com" domain was registered on January 18, 1995.
             </p>

             <p>Yahoo! is an American web services provider. It is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California and operated 
                by the namesake company Yahoo Inc., which is 90% owned by investment funds managed by
                Apollo Global Management and 10% by Verizon Communications.
             </p>

             <p>Yahoo grew rapidly throughout the 1990s. Like many search engines and web directories, Yahoo added a web portal.
                By 1998, Yahoo was the most popular starting point for web users and the human-edited Yahoo Directory the
                most popular search engine. It also made many high-profile acquisitions. Its stock price skyrocketed 
                during the dot-com bubble, Yahoo stocks closing at an all-time high of $118.75 a share on January 3, 2000.
                However, after the dot-com bubble burst, it reached a post-bubble low... Decline, security breaches, Verizon purchase
                By the fourth quarter of 2013, the company's share price had more than doubled since Marissa Mayer took 
                over as president in July 2012; however, the share price peaked at about $35 in November 2013.
