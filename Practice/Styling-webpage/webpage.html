                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
                such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1]
                CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
                This separation can improve content accessibility;
                provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
                enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
                which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file
                to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

                In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
    
                Selectors may apply to the following:
    
                all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
                elements specified by attribute, in particular:
                id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash prefix e.g. #id
                class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot prefix
                e.g. .classname (the phrase "CSS class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element classes—specified
                with the HTML class attribute—is a markup feature that is distinct from browsers' CSS subsystem and the related
                W3C/WHATWG standards work on document styles; see RDF and microformats for the origins of the "class" system of the
                Web content model) elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.
            </p>
            <p id="para-3">
                Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens,
                and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied
                to a single element.

                Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained
                in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only
                when the user "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended
                to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A pseudo-class classifies document elements,
                such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial elements,
                such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.[6] Note the double-colon notation for pseudo-elements versus
                single-colon notation for pseudo-class.
            </p>
            <p id="para-4">
                Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.[7]
                Multiple selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type,
                id, class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example,
                div .myClass {color: red;} applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements,
                whereas .myClass div {color: red;} applies to all div elements that are inside elements of class myClass.
                This is not to be confused with concatenated identifiers such as div.myClass {color: red;} which applies
                to div elements of class myClass.
